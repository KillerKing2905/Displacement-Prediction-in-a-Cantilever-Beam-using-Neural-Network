# Displacement-Prediction-in-a-Cantilever-Beam-using-Neural-Network

This project implements a Neural Network to predict the displacement in a cantilever beam under various loading conditions. The project includes source code, example datasets, and a detailed report explaining the methodology and results.

Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of a Neural Network to predict the displacement in a cantilever beam subjected to different loads. Cantilever beams are widely used in engineering structures, and accurate prediction of their displacement is crucial for design and safety. By leveraging Neural Networks, we aim to create a model that can accurately predict beam displacement based on input parameters such as load magnitude, load position, beam material properties, and beam dimensions.
